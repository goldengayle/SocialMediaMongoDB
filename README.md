# NoSQL Social Media Database Management (back-end)

## Introduction
This project demonstrates CRUD functionality using a non-relational Mongo database to store interactions between friends as commonly seen in social media sites. It was built upon functionality requirement for Challenge 18. AS A USER I want to be able to add, delete, and update user profiles associated with a social media website. I would also like to store ideas and be able for different users to react to the comments of others.

## How it was made
This project utilizes Node v16, MongoDB and Express. Routes were tested using Insomnia to render the API Calls. 
To make this project, an MVC organization was utilized, models were created utilizing schemas using the Mongoose Library, unique routes were chosen, and calls were managed by the controllers. 

## Optimizations
In the future, this project would benefit from a client-side platform. It would also be nice for users to interact using emojis.

## Lessons Learned
This project really stretched my understanding of interacting with a NoSQL database. I had fun debugging the controllers to get them working effectively.
